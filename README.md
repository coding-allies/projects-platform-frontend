### `About creating psql database locally`

- First, make sure you install and setup postgreSQL in your computer.
- Secondly, connect to psql server(run ```psqlbrew services start postgresql``` or ```sudo service postgresql start```) and create a database called scproject in psql(run ```CREATE DATABASE scproject;```).
- Then, since you already have the schema.sql in the server/data, just need to create a .env file with this variable (DATABASE_URL=postgres://your-psql-username:your-psql-password@LOCALHOST:5432/scproject) in the root. ) in there to link your node with psql.
- Lastly, in your terminal:
  1. connect to psql server. (run ```psqlbrew services start postgresql``` for Mac or ```sudo service postgresql start``` for windows and linux)
  2. connect schema.sql to psal (run ```psql -d YOUR-DB-NAME -f FILE/PATH/TO/schema.sql;```)
  3. check if db is updated(run ```\c scproject;``` to go into db, then run ```\d;``` to see if tables are created, lastly run ```SELECT * FROM table-name;``` to check the contents in that table)
